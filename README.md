# Colour Flipper ðŸŽ¨

## What the project does
The Colour Flipper is a simple web application that randomly changes the background colour of a display area when you click the "Flip Colour" button. It's designed to showcase how JavaScript can dynamically manipulate HTML elements to create interactive experiences.

## Why the project is fun
Playing with colours is always enjoyable, and the Colour Flipper allows you to do just that with a single click. Beyond the fun aspect, this project serves as a practical demonstration of basic JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation concepts.
